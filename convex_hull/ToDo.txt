To Do
=====

- analyze more carefully the inequality of is_left_of_edge()
- what happens if three or more points that end up on the convex hull are collinear?

- test more point sets

- improve function documentation headers (input, output, assumptions, etc.)

- add Python front end to graphically select input points, graphically display them,
  call slow_convex_hull with points, read in convex hull edges, graphically display them
